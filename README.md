# Anonymous-vote

This is the anonymous voting project using cosmos-sdk.
Up to now, implementation of the agenda and voting has been completed, but the anonymous system is being implemented.(not yet)


### [go installation guide ](./docs/install_guide.md)
### [anonymous-voting tutorial sample](./docs/tutorial_sample.md)


Currently, through vote_checklist everyone can show voting information.
But I'll hide this field using zero-knowledge library.
